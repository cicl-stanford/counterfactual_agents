1114,23,Non-Hispanic,I determined whether or not the box was blocking every possible route within the 10 moves.,Female,White,662204
1100,49,Non-Hispanic,I tried to see if there was a path for red to win if blue made no moves.,Male,White,529658
1091,24,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,408642
1124,35,Non-Hispanic,I tried to count the squares. No other comments. ,Male,White,387969
1112,41,Non-Hispanic,I had to count the steps to determine the outcome,Male,Asian,528269
1102,33,Non-Hispanic,I studied the map before so I knew how many moves were needed. I also knew which route would result in a win.,Male,White,532279
1115,26,Non-Hispanic,I tried to determine if the blue dot was blocking the red dot path and if so then they shouldn't have been there at all.,Female,Asian,876060
1135,71,Non-Hispanic,counted blocks,Male,White,602740
1106,42,Non-Hispanic,"Whether or not there was a box blocking the way, and whether or not red would have enough time to reach the star.",Female,White,1067944
1107,37,Non-Hispanic,I counted out the steps it would take with or without blue player and based my answers on that.,Female,White,697131
1133,26,Hispanic,"If the star was completely blocked or every path to the star was too long, I knew that the red dot would NOT have successfully finished without blue. It was pretty simple.",Female,White,658753
1116,38,Non-Hispanic,I tried to map it out as if the blue player wasn't there. Sometimes it was hard to tell,Female,White,669391
1118,37,Non-Hispanic,"I basically looked at the grid, counted the steps from the red player to the star, and checked if the red player could have successfully reached the star without the blue player's intervention.",Female,White,504321
1122,20,Non-Hispanic,,Non-binary,White,563295
1113,41,Hispanic,I knew the red player couldn't succeed at all if he needed the blue player to move a box out of the way. ,Female,American Indian/Alaska Native,635547

1105,36,Non-Hispanic,"If red could reach the box without blue's help at all, then I answered that red still could have succeeded if blue wasn't there.

1129,48,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,688698
1126,39,Hispanic,The factor that influenced my response was how many timesteps occurred by the red player before the blue player made a move that affected the red player.,Male,White,696567
1139,23,Non-Hispanic,Following the animation and counting the squares ,,White,491803
1097,28,Non-Hispanic,My responses were based on whether I could calculate a path that led to the star within the set number of moves available. I think I was faster to state that the red player would not have succeeded if there were multiple boxes between the red player and the star. ,Female,Asian,913871

1131,28,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,313197

1111,29,Non-Hispanic,The amount of spaces the red needed to move without blue being present and if a black square was blocking the path to the star. No questions.,Male,White,363519

1094,38,Non-Hispanic,"If the red player could have gotten to the star in 10 moves without the blue player on the board to change anything about the layout, I agreed that the red player would succeed without blue there, regardless of whether red succeeded or not/with blue's help or not.",Female,White,663905
1104,54,Non-Hispanic,"I just looked at each one for red's quickest route, and determined if blue had any chance of interfering with it.",Male,White,1421230
1120,30,Non-Hispanic,The factors that influenced me was my perception of the chances of the red dot reaching the star on its own. I tried to count spaces. ,Female,White,731876

1132,39,Non-Hispanic,What I saw after moving the red player myself and the playback on the screen.,Male,White,1061355
1092,49,Non-Hispanic,no,Female,White,606544
1099,20,,,Female,White,507306
1127,22,Non-Hispanic,I saw a pattern between each scenario and watched when the blue moved the block and when it didn't. I also looked at the how many moves the red had if it was blocked by the blue or not. The moves of the red played a factor in whether it was successful to get to the star as well with blue influencing where to move. ,Female,White,670061
1123,26,Hispanic,Whether or not the blue players actions affected the red players ability to complete the task and if the red player could have reached the goal at all on their own. No questions or comments.,Male,White,401079
