1218,54,Non-Hispanic,If the red had enough spaces to get to the star on it's own even if the blue didn't help or hinder that that's how I decided. If the red did not have enough steps either way is also how I decided.,Female,White,874173

1244,26,Non-Hispanic,Factors mostly of where the block was placed. And did the red dot have enough time to get there without the blue dot,Female,Black/African American,917320
1251,22,,I decided to take into account the red's path and determined whether blue got in red's way or made the way clear. I then decided to assign blame accordingly. If it looks like blue's moves didn't end up intersecting on its path at all to success or failure then I completely dismissed any contribution to red's success/failure.,,,959467
1209,33,Non-Hispanic,How much the blue player was needed to affect the outcome,Male,White,316883

1213,32,Non-Hispanic,"I think when I make my decisions, I look on if blue is trying to help red or he's trying to block. Then If he doesn't move, and it doesn't bother red's path, I think it is not responsible for the result. ",Male,White,399968
1233,28,Non-Hispanic,I chose the response based on if I thought the blue face blocked or created an access to the star.,Female,Black/African American,810575
1195,41,Non-Hispanic,"For the first half of the questions, I responded in a way thinking the slider was a toggle, either to the right or left. Only after I misclicked and let go of the slider did I realize it was variable.",Male,Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander,560901
1222,49,Non-Hispanic,"I responded positively if the blue player was helpful, and negatively if the blue player was obviously hindering the red player. I also took into account how many obstacles needed to be moved and how much help the red player would need to reach the star. 

I didn't have any problems, and enjoyed taking part in the experiment. ",Female,White,1050784
1202,27,Non-Hispanic,"Whether the red player could've reached the goal without the blue player's help, whether the blue player caused the red player to need more or less timesteps to reach the star.",Female,White,401945
1214,20,Non-Hispanic,"If the star was blocked by obstacles that could only be moved by the blue player, success or failure was the fault of the blue player. There were cases where the star was accessible but there were not enough timesteps, so the outcome was not the due to the blue player in these cases.",Non-binary,Asian,776584
1231,69,Non-Hispanic,"I paid attention to not only what the blue player did to help, but also what they actively did NOT do, but could have, to thwart the red player.  So even though the blue player might not have done much in a given game, the fact that they did not get in the way or cause more trouble than they did or could have, counts, in my mind, for help toward success",Female,White,1144998
1199,27,Non-Hispanic,I looked at whether or not the blue player moved in a way that made it impossible for the red player to reach the star. I also considered whether or not the red player would have been able to reach the star without any interference from the blue player. ,Female,Multiracial,1050165

1227,21,Non-Hispanic,I considered whether red is able to reach the star without blue moving at all. I think in one case blue appeared to help but red made the wrong moves.,Male,Asian,903733

1234,29,Non-Hispanic,I just went with my gut as to if I felt they helped or not.,Female,White,536851
1245,34,Non-Hispanic,If the blue player put the box in the way then I marked them as making the other person fail. If they helped the red player and the red player chose that path then I marked them as helping with the success.,Female,White,496692

1225,32,Non-Hispanic,"I based my decision on if the red player would've been able to succeed/fail without the blue involvement. So if blue not moving a box/moving a box into the red players way made them fail then I think blue was responsible, the same if they moved a box out of the way and helped them succeed. If red would be able to succeed or would've failed without blue's actions then I don't think blue was responsible as much",Female,White,469565
1215,36,Non-Hispanic,How much the blue ball helped the red ball,Female,White,758910
1212,45,Non-Hispanic,I tried to factor whether the red player could reach the star without the blue player's interactions. I also factored in if the red player got there faster or slower than if the blue player did nothing.,Male,White,631612
1196,34,Non-Hispanic,Whether the red player would've won or lost with it without interference of blue,Male,White,745306
1229,24,Non-Hispanic,"I feel like it was pretty obvious when blue prevented red from winning deliberately, but there were a few situations where it was ambiguous whether they helped or if them doing stuff was redundant. If I felt they were redundant I gave them a low score because red would have succeeded even if they didn't move at all.",Male,White,720232

1247,34,Non-Hispanic,"There were two main factors. One was if the red could get to the star at all regardless of what blue did, the other was whether or not blue's action increased or decreased the number of required steps (or not at all) to succeed.",Male,White,529936
