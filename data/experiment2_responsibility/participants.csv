1456,50,Non-Hispanic,I really tried to decide when watching the replays if there were any better options for either that they failed to make. Sometimes it was just that the puzzle was set up in a way neither could succeed.,Female,White,3236590

1472,21,Non-Hispanic,"The biggest influencing factor was whether blue intentionally made it more difficult or not. If not, then blue shared relatively equal amounts of credit as red, however if there was hinderance, then blue got a lot of the blame. However, I would also assign blame to red for taking the route that would allow for such compromising positions, especially if there was a path that could be taken that would not rely on blue's cooperation.

1475,22,Non-Hispanic,"My response was based on whether or not one of the dots could've succeeded without the other. If red could do it all by themselves, they were 100% responsible for the outcome. If blue hindered red's ability to reach the star, they were 100% responsible for the outcome. If blue helped by moving the box out of the way so red could reach the star, both parties are responsible, but blue more so because red most of the time would likely not reach the star if blue hadn't helped.",Female,White,726625
